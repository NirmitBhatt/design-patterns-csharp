# Observer Design Pattern
***

#### Observer is a Behavioral Design Pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing.

#### It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects where: 

1. One object is the "Observable" (Subject/Publisher) and
2. Other objects are "Observers" (Subscribers)
